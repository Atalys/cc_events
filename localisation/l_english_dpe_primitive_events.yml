To them, it appeared as unexplainable lights and flashes in the sky, which they interpreted as a battle between their Gods - something perhaps not that inaccurate."
mem_dpe_primitives.2.renaissance:0 "The civilisation on [mem_dpe_primitive_planet.GetName] was witness to the recent space battle in the [mem_dpe_primitive_system.GetName], though they did not comprehend the truth of what was happening. To them, it appeared as unexplainable lights and flashes in the sky. Many of the more superstitious interpreted it as some sort of message from, or battle between, the Gods. Their budding astronomical community has been at loss to explain the sightings, though there has been no shortage of attempts to do so!"
mem_dpe_primitives.2.machine:0 "The civilisation on [mem_dpe_primitive_planet.GetName] was witness to the recent space battle in the [mem_dpe_primitive_system.GetName], though they did not comprehend the truth of what was happening. Despite their increasingly advanced understanding of astronomy, [mem_dpe_primitive_civ.GetSpeciesAdj] scientists were left stumped by the sightings of unexplainable lights and flashes in the sky, which corresponded to nothing they had ever witnessed before. This has provided the conspiracy theorists, who - correctly, as it happens - believe there is an alien presence in the [mem_dpe_primitive_system.GetName] System, though as of yet they have no way of proving this."
mem_dpe_primitives.2.space_age:0 "The civilisation on [mem_dpe_primitive_planet.GetName] was witness to the recent space battle in the [mem_dpe_primitive_system.GetName], which appeared to them as unexplainable lights and flashes in the sky. Their astronomers, who within their limitations have built up a relatively advanced image of the galaxy, were at a loss to explain these new sightings. Many within [mem_dpe_primitive_civ.GetSpeciesAdj] society are openly speculating that it was evidence of alien activity. They are already planning to send several drones to investigate the areas of the system affected by the battle. It is only a matter of time before they detect our presence."

We are no match for your might, but perhaps, in a few years, we will be able to join you in the stars. When we do so, we hope to do so as your friends and partners, whom you will guide to the discovery of new Truths, rather than as ones you would see as heathens or enemies. We sincerely hope that you agree with this sentiment.\n\nWe await your answer with hope and trepidation in equal measure.\n\nYours sincerely,\nThe [mem_dpe_primitive_civ.GetSpeciesAdj] Council"
